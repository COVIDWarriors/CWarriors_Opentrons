# COVIDWarriors

Current global pandemic due to the SARS-COVID19 have struggled and pushed the limits of global health systems. Supply chain disruptions and scarce availability of RNA extraction kits have motivated worldwide actors to do research on virus detection systems.

The NGO ***COVIDWarriors*** coordinated a donation to multiple hospitals in Spain to automate the PCR testing of SARS-CoV2 by suppplying them with opensource programmable robots  developed by the US company ***Opentrons***. They also collaborated with the deployment and COVID19 protocols programming.
