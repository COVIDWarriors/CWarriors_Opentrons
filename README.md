# COVIDWarriors

Current global pandemic due to the SARS-COVID19 have struggled and pushed the limits of global health systems. Supply chain disruptions and scarce availability of RNA extraction kits have motivated worldwide actors to do research on virus detection systems.

The NGO ***COVIDWarriors*** made a donation to multiple hospitals in Spain to automate the PCR testing of SARS-cov2 by suppplying them with opensource programmable robots, developed by the US company ***Opentrons***. They also collaborated in the installation and setup by providing one engineer.

The following methodology prepared in this repository will take advantage of commercial kits to perform the RNA extraction.

The main contributors have developed some multipurpouse coding methodology which has been very useful to prepare the extraction protocols.
